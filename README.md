# Credit Card Fraud Detection - Capstone Project

## Overview

This capstone project focuses on developing an efficient machine learning model to accurately detect credit card fraud, significantly reducing financial losses caused by fraudulent transactions.

## Problem Statement

Credit card fraud presents substantial challenges and financial implications for institutions and individuals. This project aims to tackle the highly imbalanced nature of fraud data to build a robust detection system.

## Data Analysis & Preparation

- **Dataset:** [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arockiaselciaa/creditcardcsv)
- **Key Insights:**
  - Severe class imbalance (280,000 legitimate transactions vs. ~400 fraudulent transactions).
  - Significant correlations identified: Features V17, V14, V12.
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Normalized data using StandardScaler.
  - Balanced dataset using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), improving fraud class ratio from 0.17% to 50%.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries & Tools:**
  - **Data Manipulation:** Pandas, NumPy
  - **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn
  - **Deep Learning:** Keras
  - **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - **Hyperparameter Tuning:** RandomizedSearchCV
- **Models Implemented:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Network

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Extreme Class Imbalance:**
  - *Solution:* Implemented SMOTE algorithm for class balancing.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization:**
  - *Solution:* Utilized RandomizedSearchCV for efficient parameter tuning.
- **Model Generalization:**
  - *Solution:* Applied cross-validation for robust evaluation.
